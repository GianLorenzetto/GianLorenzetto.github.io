A bug can be numerous different things. Common classes of faults include

* Deployment issues
* Programming errors
* Business logic mistakes
* Integration errors

These are not all the same and they do not have common causes.

Often it is also not the code change itself (nor the developer making the change!) that is to blame. Rather it is implicit assumptions and miscommunication that are the problem. That is, many errors find their root cause in the systemic nature of the team, department or organisation.
