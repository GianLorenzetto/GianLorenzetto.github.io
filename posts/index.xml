Staying strong and continuing to enjoy doing the career path I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen for myself hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been easy. Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re in a toxic environment, could be team mates, management, resources, time pressure or all of the above. You feel trapped and essentially powerless to affect change. Lots of us have been there, but what do you do?
One of the reasons I joined Readify was to steer my career down a path where I would be able to affect greater change, across multiple organisations, than I could doing plain old full-time development.</description></item></channel></rss>
