Our main goal was to create a fully functional CI server in Azure, with TeamCity for builds and OctopusDeploy for deployments.
Why? Firstly, although we both had some experience in parts of the technologies involved, neither of us had built a complete end-to-end environment, from scratch. Just sounded like too much fun!
Secondly, during my career as a software developer one of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that many sites do not have a fully automated build and deployment environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
