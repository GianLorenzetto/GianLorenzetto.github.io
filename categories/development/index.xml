It looks something like:
[Route(some/route/{*key})] This ASP.Net article has a good example (search for the &amp;lsquo;wildcard&amp;rsquo; section).
Essentially, everything beyond the route/ part of the url will be assigned to the key variable. For example, the route
some/route/more/parts/here?param=1
results in
key = &amp;#34;more/parts/here?param=1&amp;#34;; This can be useful for things like file storage and other uri params that may include folder paths or similar.</description></item></channel></rss>
