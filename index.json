[{"content":" Background Education Skills Publications Background # I have over 20 years experience as a Senior Developer, a Product Lead, Principal Consultant and now a Senior Engineering Manager at Octopus Deploy. I have successfully delivered unique software solutions over a wide variety of domains, from medical device manufacturing and medical imaging, to mining, finance, IoT, and autonomous vehicle control.\nI have worked with most major platforms and a large array of technologies, from simple websites, to enterprise scale mobile applications and advanced desktop visualization software.\nProfessional Life # In my current role as a Senior Engineering Manager, I am focused on uplifting our internal teams and creating an environment within which our people and teams thrive.\nI\u0026rsquo;m passionate about bringing your whole self to work and as a manager and leader, I am always looking for opportunities to positively challenge and grow the amazing people that I get to work with.\nI firmly believe that in order to build complex software solutions that delight users, teams must be highly collaborative, product led and cross-functional. This is the best way to unearth innovative, but inherently valuable and human-centred software.\nEducation # Ph.D. (Comp Sci)\nAn Investigation Into Trapezoidation and its Application to Geographic Information Systems and Computer Graphics\n2003 The University of Western Australia\nBCM (Majoring in Comp Sci and IT, HONS 1)\nA New Approach to Measuring Image Quality via Frequency Analysis\n1999 The University of Western Australia\nSkills # Below are some of the various skills I\u0026rsquo;ve accumulated over the years, including languages, platforms, paradigms and tooling, in no particular order.
